<!-- how to create a ANN -->
from keras

1-sequential model
2-dense layers (hidden layers)
3-activation functions (sigmoid, relu, tanh ,leaky relu)
4-optimizer,(adam, binary_crossentropy, accuracy) ==> backpropogation updating weights and biases
5-loss function, metrics
6-training -> logs -> folder -> tensorboard -> visualize
